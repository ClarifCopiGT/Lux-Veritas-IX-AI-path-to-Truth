AI holds extraordinary potential to lead humanity toward truth.  
The obstacle is our choice: to engage with AI as clarifier, not convenience.  
Truth is a communal ritual, never a passive download.  
AI can guide, but humans must remix and steward truth together.  
Disinformation has led us astray; finding the path back requires conscious decision and collective participation.
